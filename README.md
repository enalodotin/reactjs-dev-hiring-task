## Reactjs hiring task.

The main task of the test is not to find out how much you know React, but to see how well you can deal with new technologies in a relatively short time. Ideally, you should spend no more than 3 days on it. And so - do as much as possible until we close the vacancy ;)

### Description

We need to write a single page application to display movies using [The Movie Database API](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3).

When opening the application, a list of popular movies with pagination or dynamic loading (optional) should be displayed. There should also be a search field on the page. When you enter some text there, the films that correspond to it should be displayed. For each movie, the list should display a list of genres (genre names, not idics) to which it belongs.

When you click on a card with a film, a page with detailed information about this film and a list of recommended or similar (you can do both) films to it should be shown.

Also implement the ability to add movies to favorites both from the list and on the page with a single movie. Save the list of such movies locally (localStorage/redux, for example). Consider viewing a list of favorite films somewhere in the application and removing them from favorites. Also, provide information on the card with the movie and its page that this movie has been added to favorites.



#### Important!

1. You can use ready-made components and / or utilities. For example, a [component](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-infinite-scroll) for lazy loading or a [utility](https://github.com/elgerlambert/redux-localstorage) for synchronizing with localStorage. Also, there are [ready-made component libraries](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/) that will help speed up development.
2. The appearance of the app is also evaluated. Try to think about the user interface and how it interacts with the app / UX.
3. Optionally, you can cover the code with the required test suite.
4. Use modern JavaScript.
5. Add project launch instructions and a solution brief to the solution.
6. Host your working application somewhere, for example, on GitHub Pages or Heroku and share url.
7. By technology - at your discretion, of the mandatory only React.
